# AWS-DeepRacer
Welcome to my AWS DeepRacer repository. This repo showcases my experiment that ranked among the **top 10** in **Egypt_DR_Jan25**. My model achieved a qualifying time of **8.4 seconds** with **0 off-tracks**, demonstrating strong performance in autonomous racing.

This repository includes my approach, training strategy, and key optimizations that contributed to this result.
## About AWS DeepRacer
[AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) is a cloud-based autonomous racing platform that helps developers learn reinforcement learning (RL) through hands-on experience. It provides a **1/18th scale autonomous car**, a **3D racing simulator**, and a **global competition** where participants train RL models to navigate virtual tracks efficiently.

DeepRacer allows users to experiment with different reward functions, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve their modelâ€™s performance. The platform supports **sim-to-real transfer**, enabling trained models to run on physical DeepRacer cars.

Competitions are held at **AWS DeepRacer League** events, where participants compete for the fastest lap times while minimizing penalties like off-tracks and collisions.
## Experiment details
| Category | Details |
|-|-|
|Race type | Time trial |
| Ranking method | Best lap time |
| Style | Individual lap |
| Entry criteria | 3 consecutive laps |
| Off-track penalty | 3 seconds |

### Overview of the Experiment:
The experiment involved training an AWS DeepRacer agent over **10 iterations**, taking **7 hours and 45 minutes**. Different reward functions and hyperparameters were tested throughout the training process to optimize performance. The model achieved a **best lap time of 8.4 seconds** while maintaining **0 off-tracks**.

### The approach
I first focused on enhancing the reward function to improve the agent's learning process. Then, I worked on optimizing speed and hyperparameters together to balance exploration and exploitation for better performance.
